This project provides a simple and customizable way to send emails from a PHP server using SMTP authentication and SSL/TLS encryption.

Features
Send emails using SMTP servers.

Secure email sending via SSL/TLS encryption.

Simple configuration using environment variables.

Error handling and debugging for improved user experience.

Customizable sender and recipient details.

Supports HTML email format for advanced content formatting.

Requirements
PHP 7.0 or higher

Composer (for managing dependencies)

A valid SMTP server (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid, or custom SMTP server)

PHPMailer library (installed via Composer)

Installation
Step 1: Clone the repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

git clone https://github.com/Changdev-2001/PHPMailer-project.git

Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd phpmailer-project
composer install
This will install PHPMailer and any other required libraries as defined in composer.json.

Step 3: Set up environment variables
Copy the .env.local file to .env and modify it with your SMTP credentials:

bash
Copy
Edit
cp .env.local .env
In the .env file, define the following environment variables:

ini
Copy
Edit
GMAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
GMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
Note: For Gmail, use an App Password instead of your main Gmail password for better security.

Step 4: Running the Project
Once you have configured the .env file, you can run the PHP script (sendmail.php) to test the email functionality.

bash
Copy
Edit
php sendmail.php
The script will send an email using your SMTP credentials to the configured recipient.

Usage
sendmail.php: The main file for sending emails.

Customize the sender and recipient email addresses.

Set up the email subject and body content (HTML or plain text).

.env: Store environment variables securely, such as email credentials and SMTP settings.

Debugging
Enable debugging to view detailed logs by adjusting the SMTPDebug parameter:

php
